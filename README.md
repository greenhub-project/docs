## What is GreenHub?

> GreenHub is a collaborative approach to power consumption analysis of Android devices.

It is a project developed in the context of **Green Computing** research field.

The goal of this initiative is to collect data about energy consumption from Android devices in order to have real-world data to conduct further research, while making it available to the whole community.

Our approach to gather data is based on the **crowsourcing** model.

Within the project, there are different modules in development, all collectively designated by **GreenHub**.

So far, the following applications are being developed:

- [GreenHub BatteryHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hmatalonga.greenhub) - Android app
- [GreenHub Farmer](https://greenhub.di.ubi.pt/) - Backend web app + REST API
- [GreenHub Lumberjack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/greenhub-cli) - A command line app for interacting with the GreenHub REST API
