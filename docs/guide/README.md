# Introduction

## What is GreenHub?

> GreenHub is a collaborative approach to power consumption analysis of Android devices.

It is a project developed in the context of **Green Computing** research field.

The goal of this initiative is to collect data about energy consumption from Android devices in order to have real-world data to conduct further research, while making it available to the whole community.

Our approach to gather data is based on the **crowsourcing** model.
